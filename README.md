# Reflection on lab 3

This lab whas pretty straight forward so i didn't have so much trouble with it.
I did mostly learn about how to write and read from files and how "cin" and "cout" actually worked.
The lab was good and i can't directly see how it could be improved.


I put in about 10h on this lab
